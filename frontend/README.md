## Pages

### Login & Sign Up
Entry point of the app. Users must create an account and log in to access any other page. JWT token is stored in `localStorage` after login.

### Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
The main page after login. Includes:
- **Search bar** — searches the shared site database by keyword
- **Search results** — color-coded by passkey support:
  - Blue (`🔑 Native Passkey`) — same-site / same-brand passkey support
  - Amber (`🔗 3rd Party Passkey`) — passkey support exposed through an external IdP
  - Red (`🔒 No Passkey`) — no passkey support detected
- **Search the Web button** — appears when no DB results are found; triggers the Playwright crawler on the backend
- **Search history** — personal list of past searches, with delete and clear options
- **Navigation buttons** in the header to reach the three public dashboards

### Passkey Sites (`/passkey-sites`)
Public dashboard showing all sites classified as `native` passkey support, across all users. Includes a live filter bar to search by name or URL.

### Third-Party Passkey Sites (`/third-party-sites`)
Public dashboard showing all sites classified as `third-party` passkey support. Same layout and filter capability as the other public boards.

### No Passkey Sites (`/no-passkey-sites`)
Public dashboard showing all sites classified as `none`. Same layout and filter capability as the other public boards.

### Settings (`/settings`)
Allows the logged-in user to update their username.
